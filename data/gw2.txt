Guild Wars 2 is a free-to-play,[2] massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by ArenaNet and published by NCSoft. Set in the fantasy world of Tyria, the core game follows the re-emergence of Destiny's Edge, a disbanded guild dedicated to fighting Elder Dragons, colossal Lovecraftian-esque entities that have seized control of Tyria in the time since the original Guild Wars (2005), a plot line that was concluded in the latest expansion End of Dragons (2022). The game takes place in a persistent world with a story that progresses in instanced environments.[3]

Guild Wars 2 is the fourth major entry in the Guild Wars series, and claims to be unique in the MMO genre[4] by featuring a storyline that is responsive to player actions,[5] something which is common in single player role-playing games but rarely seen in multiplayer ones. A dynamic event system replaces traditional questing,[6] utilising the ripple effect to allow players to approach quests in different ways as part of a persistent world. Also of note is the combat system, which aims to be more dynamic than its predecessor by promoting synergy between professions and using the environment as a weapon,[7][8] as well as reducing the complexity of the Magic-style skill system of the original game.

As a sequel to Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2 features the same lack of subscription fees that distinguished its predecessor from other commercially developed online games of the time, though until August 2015 a purchase was still required to install the game.[9] The game sold over two million copies in its first two weeks.[10][11] By August 2013, the peak player concurrency had reached 460,000.[12] By August 2015, over 5 million copies had been sold, at which point the base game became free-to-play.[13] By August 2021, over 16 million accounts have been created.[14] On 16th August 2022, it was announced that Guild Wars 2 will be releasing on Steam as part of the game's 10th year anniversary celebration.[15]

Three major expansion packs have been released for the game thus far; Heart of Thorns (2015), Path of Fire (2017) and End of Dragons (2022), with a fourth expansion pack in development, announced on March 22, 2022.[16] The expansion packs introduce new content, including new regions of the world to explore, masteries, professions, elite specializations, and seasons of 'Living World'; live content updates that continue expansion storylines and bridge the gap between them.[17]
